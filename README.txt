General specifications

* the entire source code is written in c++ with the GUI implemented 
  in Qt (prior intimation about choosing Qt for the GUI was delivered to 
  the I/C, permission for which was granted as well)

* the GUI interacts with the c++ source code files for the algorithms through
  four primary API methods:

	-- addNormalPoint()
	-- addNormalLine()
	-- addBoldPoint()
	-- addBoldLine()

* all the source code files can be found in the 
  2016A7PS0049H_csf364_a1/DAA-Hulls-final directory

* the GUI will work only if the host system has Qt framework and Qt creator 
  installed on it 

* once installed, please delete the DAA-Hulls.pro.user file from the 
  DAA-Hulls-final directory and open the same directory as a project in Qt Creator

* to initiate the GUI, simply hit the Run button on the side panel once all 
  the files in the directory have been opened in Qt Creator

* the entire documentation for all the source code files can be viewd as HTML
  pages: Go to 2016A7PS0049H_csf364_a1/docs_daa1/html and click on annotated.html 
  to view the same

* a cumulative report of the entire assignment's findings and inferences, along 
  with the tabulation/plotting of individual test-case specific running times
  can be found in the 2016A7PS0049H_csf364_a1/final_report.pdf file
